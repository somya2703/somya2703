### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**somya2703/somya2703** 
You have landed on Somya's GIT!!!!!
I'm trying to document my journey in the field of DATA SCIENCE. In this day and age of open source and online education 
finding a resource is just a matter of few clicks but finding the right one can be a tedious task. 
I have spent hours to do so. I thought I'll save you a few by sharing the good ones with you.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a stressed out final year engineering student.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ANYTHING! (If I don't know about it, I'll just google it and save you the trouble :D)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Pull a request here!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are times coffee makes me sleepy. :(
